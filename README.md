### Explanation of Folders

#### `android/` and `ios/`
- These directories contain native platform-specific code for Android and iOS, respectively.

#### `lib/`
- **`main.dart`**: The main entry point of the application.
- **`core/`**: Contains core functionalities that are shared across the app:
  - `constants/`: App-wide constants like colors, strings, and dimensions.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `services/`: App-wide services, such as APIs and local storage handling.
  - `models/`: Data models for the app.

- **`features/`**: Organized by app features or modules:
  - Each feature contains:
    - `screens/`: The UI screens for that feature.
    - `widgets/`: Reusable components specific to the feature.
    - `providers/`: State management classes for that feature.

- **`common/`**: Reusable widgets or components shared across features.

- **`config/`**: Application configuration settings:
  - `env.dart`: Environment-specific configurations.
  - `routes.dart`: App navigation and route management.
  - `themes.dart`: Theme configurations.

#### `test/`
- Contains unit and widget tests, organized in a structure mirroring the `lib/` directory.

#### `assets/`
